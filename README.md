# PL-0 Compiler

# Introduction
This project is a compiler for the PL/0 programming language. It was written entirely in C.  
This was a semester-long project for the COP 3402 *(Systems Software)* class at UCF.

# Function
This PL/0 compiler includes a lexical analyzer, parser (syntax analyzer), machine code generator. It also includes a PM/0 virtual machine that is designed to support features such as function calls, passing parameters, and recursion.  
Given a program written in PL/0 programming language, the compiler will check the syntax, generate a symbol table, generate machine code, and finally run the machine code.
